## Interactive Resume Project 
Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Project 2

## Project Overview
Develop an interactive resume application that reads all resume content from a JSON file and dynamically displays that content within a provided template.  Objects, functions, conditionals, and control structures will be used to compose the content that will display on the resume. This project is prepared under instructions of two Udacity courses, namely "JavaScript Basics" and "Intro to jQuery".
