## Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree
## Project 2 - Interactive Resume

## Brief description
Develop an interactive resume application that reads all resume content from a JSON file and dynamically displays that content within a provided template.  Objects, functions, conditionals, and control structures will be used to compose the content that will display on the resume. This project is prepared under instructions of two Udacity courses, namely "JavaScript Basics" and "Intro to jQuery".

The repository includes the following files:

* **index.html**: The main HTML document. Contains links to all of the CSS and JS resources needed to render the resume, including resumeBuilder.js.
* **js/helper.js**: Contains helper code needed to format the resume and build the map. It also has a few function shells for additional functionality. More on helper.js further down.
* **js/resumeBuilder.js**: Contains code to build the resume.
* **js/jQuery.js**: The jQuery library.
* **css/style.css**: Contains all of the CSS needed to style the page.
* **css/normalize.css**: A customisable CSS file that makes browsers render all elements more consistently and in line with modern standards.
* **README.md**: The GitHub readme file.
* **images/**: Some images in the images directory.
